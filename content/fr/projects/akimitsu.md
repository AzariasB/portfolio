Akimitsu is a discord bot used by more than 9000 servers.

It uses typescript, redis, postgresql.

It has two sibling projects that I created, one in Kotlin, and one in rust : [bilderna](https://github.com/PixelaxFR/bilderna).

[A summary of the bot's capacity](https://top.gg/bot/471749111125770250).
